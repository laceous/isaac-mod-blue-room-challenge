This mod adds 4 custom challenges.

[b][u]Blue Room Challenge[/u][/b]

Play as Blue Baby and go fight yourself in the Chest.

Between each room is a hidden blue room. Doorways will glow blue to alert you to their presence. Once you clear and leave a blue room, it will disappear.

A random boss pool item and Book of Revelations will spawn in the first room.

[b][u]Blue Room Challenge (Cursed)[/u][/b]

Each blue room is covered in a layer of cursed mist that temporarily reduces you to base items and stats.

[b][u]Dark Room Challenge[/u][/b]

Tainted Judas wants in on the fun. Fight your way to The Lamb in the Dark Room.

All of the Blue Room Challenge rules apply here. Additionally, you'll be surrounded in a cone of complete darkness.

Dark Arts can help get you out of tricky situations.

A random boss pool item and Satanic Bible will spawn in the first room.

[b][u]Dark Room Challenge (Cursed)[/u][/b]

Can you deal with the cone of darkness and cursed mist?

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]

If you enter a blue room from a large room, clear the blue room, and exit via the entrance door: you might find yourself against the correct wall, but at the wrong door slot. This is a bug with the game. The same thing happens in a normal run with the blue key.</description>
